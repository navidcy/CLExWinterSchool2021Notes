%In this lecture we derive the key equation for the water mass transformation (WTM), a process described in Groeskamp et al., 2019 as ``the mass transport of sea water through a surface with a constant propery value". Based on the tools learnt through this course we should be able to use a few approximations to calculate transformation in a model.
